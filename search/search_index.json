Our demagogues spun visions of prosperity, free energy, eternal life. But those gifts were for highborns. Useless eaters. Genetic hazards: That's what they called us. We were lied to, our minds and bodies poisoned. A single voice couldn't break their hold. But the blood of martyrs stoked a flame."},{"location":"3_lore/#the-plan","title":"The Plan","text":"Stuxnet-terminus is what I named it. Armageddon rolled into 16 kilobytes of binary. My magnum opus, a final fuck you to the suits. There was one target: an actuator deep within the Global Village Fusion Center. The complex was impenetrable, its entire network air-gapped, with Faraday shields that could withstand a tactical nuke. Droids kept the equipment in good repair. Perfectly compliant. GVFC mercs made sure no unregistered soft bodies came within two clicks of the perimeter walls.  There was one crack in the defense: A lone engineer, Dimitar Borisov. A Bulgarian prick and the only human allowed into the facility interior. Every full moon, he'd descend into the Fusion Center's bowels to upgrade firmware.      They could have had a drone load the patches, but sociopaths get off to that kind of theater. Which was fine enough. We cooked and sent the payload: Everything touching got a copy. In nine months, Mr. Borisov's implant pinged us."},{"location":"3_lore/#the-aftermath","title":"The Aftermath","text":"Temperature, coordinates, kernel process, the FPGA's MAC address--over one-hundred parameters accounted for. Nicking that info wasn't easy. And the consequences... What happened next... well, maybe there's something to that starlord crap the suits peddle. Dimensional rifts? A disease? Mutation? Whatever it is, unholy ambition put us to war against undead hordes. Against ourselves.  <p>Welcome to a Shattered Requiem, where enemies are born in chaos. And allies in blood. Find the Citadel, our stronghold and safe haven, or try taking for yourself. Carve a path. Hunt for treasure. And defy this abysmal fate.</p> <p>Prepare yourself. Night is coming.</p> <p>Doulos Khristos</p> <p>GVFC Citadel</p>"}]}
