# Welcome to Shattered Requiem

## A Message to Players

Survivor,

The promise of Utopia, a new Atlantis, was empty. Our demagogues crafted visions of prosperity, free energy, eternal life. But such blessings were meant for the highborn. Useless eaters, they called us. Genetic hazards to prune like a crooked shoot. We were lied to, our minds poisoned, and our bodies by the water, through the food. A single voice couldn't break their hold. But the blood of martyrs nourished a rebellion.

Project Aion was about to go online--their religious climax into godhood. Iter hacked the CCTVs at the Citadel and we saw those bastards congratulating each other, indulging sick pleasures. Quite the pinnacle of humanity, with plans to vacate and cleanse the planet. We fought back with the means we had: scorched earth suicide.

Stuxnet-terminus. Thatâ€™s what I named it. Armageddon rolled into 16 kilobytes of binary. It had one target: an actuator deep within the Global Village Fusion Center. The complex was impenetrable, its entire network air-gapped, with Faraday shields that could withstand a tactical nuke. Droids kept the equipment in good repair. Perfectly compliant. GVFC mercs made sure no unregistered soft bodies came within two clicks of the perimeter walls. There was one crack in the defense: a lone engineer, Dimitar Borisov.

He was a Bulgarian prick. Would slink into the fortress's bowels to upgrade firmware once every full moon, like a high priest on Yom Kippur. They could have had a drone load the patches. Sociopaths get off to that kind of theater, though. Makes them feel important. Which was fine enough. We cooked and propagated the payload: Everything that touched the net sucked it up. In nine months, Mr. Borisov's implant pinged us.

Temperature, coordinates, kernel process, MAC on the FPGA: over one-hundred parameters accounted for. Nicking that info wasn't easy. Disguising the exploit, that was the real bitch. It was my *magnum opus*, a final fuck you to the suits. What happened next... maybe there's something to that starlord crap they're peddling. Dimensional rifts? A disease or mutation? Whatever it is, the explosion bought us a new life. 

Unholy ambition plunged us into a desperate war. Against undead hordes. Against ourselves. I welcome you to a Shattered Requiem. Enemies are born in chaos and allies forged in blood.

Find the Citadel, a stronghold and safe haven. Align with us, that's what I recommend. Or take it for yourself if you can. Carve your path, hunt treasure and danger. And prepare yourself. Night is coming.
