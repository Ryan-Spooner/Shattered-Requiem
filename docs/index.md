# Welcome to Shattered Requiem

## The Draw

---
<div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;justify-content:space-between">
    <div style="width:90%">The promise of Utopia--a new Atlantis--was empty. Our demagogues spun visions of prosperity, free energy, eternal life. But those gifts were for highborns. Useless eaters. Genetic hazards: That's what they called us. We were lied to, our minds and bodies poisoned. A single voice couldn't break their hold. But the blood of martyrs stoked a flame.

## The Plan

<div style="padding-top:1rem;padding-bottom:0.5rem">Stuxnet-terminus is what I named it. Armageddon rolled into 16 kilobytes of binary. My <em>magnum opus</em>, a final fuck you to the suits. There was one target: an actuator deep within the Global Village Fusion Center. The complex was impenetrable, its entire network air-gapped, with Faraday shields that could withstand a tactical nuke. Droids kept the equipment in good repair. Perfectly compliant. GVFC mercs made sure no unregistered soft bodies came within two clicks of the perimeter walls.

<div style="padding:1rem 0;display:flex;align-items:flex-start;justify-content:space-between">
    <div style="width:90%">There was one crack in the defense, just big enough to slip through: A lone engineer, Dimitar Borisov. A Bulgarian prick and the only human allowed into the facility interior. Every full moon, he'd descend into the Fusion Center's bowels to upgrade firmware.

    </div>
    <div style="padding-left:1rem;width:90%">They could have had a drone load the patches. Sociopaths get off to that kind of theater, though. Which was fine enough. We cooked and propagated a payload: Everything that touched the net got a copy. In nine months, Mr. Borisov's implant pinged us.

## The Aftermath

---
<div>Temperature, coordinates, kernel process, MAC on the FPGA--over one-hundred parameters accounted for. Nicking that info wasn't easy. Disguising the exploit, that was the real bitch. What happened next, well, maybe there's something to that starlord crap they're peddling. Dimensional rifts? A disease? Mutation? Whatever it is, the explosion bought us a new life. Unholy ambition put us into a desperate war against undead hordes. Against ourselves.

Welcome you to a Shattered Requiem, where enemies are born in chaos, and allies in blood. I invite you to find the Citadel, our stronghold and a safe haven. Or you can try taking for yourself... Carve a path, hunt treasure and defy this abysmal fate.

<p><strong>Prepare yourself. Night is coming.</strong></p>
