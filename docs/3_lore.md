## The Draw

---
<div style="display:flex;align-items:flex-start;justify-content:space-between">
    <div style="width:90%">The promise of Utopia--a new Atlantis--was empty. Our demagogues spun visions of prosperity, free energy, eternal life. But those gifts were for highborns. Useless eaters. Genetic hazards: That's what they called us. We were lied to, our minds and bodies poisoned. A single voice couldn't break their hold. But the blood of martyrs stoked a flame.

## The Plan

<div style="padding-top:1rem;padding-bottom:0.5rem">Stuxnet-terminus is what I named it. Armageddon rolled into 16 kilobytes of binary. My <em>magnum opus</em>, a final fuck you to the suits. There was one target: an actuator deep within the Global Village Fusion Center. The complex was impenetrable, its entire network air-gapped, with Faraday shields that could withstand a tactical nuke. Droids kept the equipment in good repair. Perfectly compliant. GVFC mercs made sure no unregistered soft bodies came within two clicks of the perimeter walls.

<div style="padding:1rem 0;display:flex;align-items:flex-start;justify-content:space-between">
    <div style="width:90%">There was one crack in the defense: A lone engineer, Dimitar Borisov. A Bulgarian prick and the only human allowed into the facility interior. Every full moon, he'd descend into the Fusion Center's bowels to upgrade firmware.

    <div style="padding-left:1rem;width:90%">They could have had a drone load the patches, but sociopaths get off to that kind of theater. Which was fine enough. We cooked and sent the payload: Everything touching got a copy. In nine months, Mr. Borisov's implant pinged us.

## The Aftermath

---
<div>Temperature, coordinates, kernel process, the FPGA's MAC address--over one-hundred parameters accounted for. Nicking that info wasn't easy. And the consequences... What happened next... well, maybe there's something to that starlord crap the suits peddle. Dimensional rifts? A disease? Mutation? Whatever it is, unholy ambition put us to war against undead hordes. Against ourselves.
